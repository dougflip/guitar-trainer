# Guitar Trainer

A web app to help you practice guitar.
Users can build practice sessions which consist of 1 or more exercise.
An exercise displays a note in time to a metronome (in the future maybe more options).

An example of an exercise might be to play a triad with the root on the B string.
Then, as each note is displayed you play the corresponding triad.
This helps to drill note recognition while working on triads.

## Local Development

```sh
# select proper Node version
nvm use

# install deps
npm install

# start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Vite's output in your terminal will output the URL of the dev server.
